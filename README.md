# Random Rumor Simulation App

This project contains an angular app to visualize a simple randomized rumor spreading process in an undirected graph. 
It offers a possibility to travel through the iteration steps of the simulation to visualize the spreading process.
This frontend app is written in angular using tailwind css and material angular components. Animations and graph visualisations were build with d3.js.
